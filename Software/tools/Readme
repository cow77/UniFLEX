Here you may find 'ported' Unix(r) programs, newly created - and handy tools

tar   a very capable tar utility, it does NOT support compression however
use2  a slightly modified version of the use screen editor, this one runs also via th IOP.

MON6809 is a MikBug(r) derivate which can be used in the CPU09 system. It lacks diskboot functionalty
but can load and 'punch' S1 records. Initila DATRAM map is

0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F
00 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX FF

SO only ram page 0000-0fff is present as is the IO/ROM page F000-FFFF mapped in. XX means not assigned.
The stack resides at 007F and lower. Also the monitor variable sare in the lower RAM area.
The ROM sits at F800-FFFF and initialyses the hardware on the CPU board in a way that it will work.
