Posted the latest version of the unibug code as unibug_b.t

This version has added handling of CPU mode in user processes. The context

On return it checks the save state and applies that when the user process
is returned to.

Another bug that has been caught is, there was NO stack yet when debini 
was called. Now we setup the first stack in the datbox and later we switch
to the rom stack,
