Posted the latest version of the unibug code as unibug_b.t

This version has added handling of CPU mode in user processes. The context 
switching code save the orginal CPU mode, set's the CPU to 63X09 native
for the kernel.
On return it checks the save state and applies that when the user process
is returned to.

Another bug that has been caught is, there was NO stack yet when debini 
was called. Now we setup the first stack in the datbox and later we switch
to the rom stack,

Added bootcode for floppy disk and upped the revision. With the 'F' command
you can boot from floppy, provided that the CPU09GPP/09FLP combo is present
in the system. The code tries all variants SD/DD and 5"/8".
The resulting bootsector (block 0, sector 1) will be placed at 00800 in kernel
space and after succesful load, it jumps to the first byte of the bootsector.
Failures result in an SWI trap.
