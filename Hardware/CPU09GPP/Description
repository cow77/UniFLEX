The CPU09GPP provides:

* local HD63C09 CPU at 4MHz clocks
* 1Kx8 dual port RAM between host CPU and local CPU with interrupt flags and arbritration logic
* up to 32KB of local RAM
* up to 16KB of (E)EPROM
* up to 1K Bytes of dedicated IO space (A0...A9)
* local periodic timer interrupt circuitry (6.7, 13, 26 mS)
* LED which show host CPU access and local CPU access
* local CPU can be indivudiably reset from bus pin
* the CPU09GPP has it own address decoding for the system bus. (Page select for F8,F9,FA,FB or FE) Cardselect 0...3
* 40 pin IO expansion connector with local Data, Address and Control signals. Can handle DMA.

The schematic diagram is the first (proto) version of the design
