The CPU09GPP provides:* local HD63C09 CPU at 4MHz clocks* 1Kx8 dual port RAM between host CPU and local CPU with interrupt flags and arbritration logic* up to 32KB of local RAM* up to 16KB of (E)EPROM* up to 1K Bytes of dedicated IO space (A0...A9)* local periodic timer interrupt circuitry (6.7, 13, 26 mS)* LED which show host CPU access and local CPU access* local CPU can be indivudiably reset from bus pin* the CPU09GPP has it own address decoding for the system bus. (Page select for F8,F9,FA,FB or FE (default)) Cardselect 0...3* 40 pin IO expansion connector with local Data, Address and Control signals. Can handle DMA.The schematic diagram is the first (proto) version of the designFor the proto board version a minor change is needed. Pin 20 of G1 is to be completely free, so 2 cuts at each side of that pin.A new wire from pagesel2 at the jumper block to pin 3 of G1 and next to pin 5 of array RA2. Of course the final version willhave these things resolved. Originally pin 3 of G1 served for B_Q. We can miss that here, but we need to cut the track for thissignal.

Note that this project is still in the experimental state!2020-09-29:As mentioned in the README file, the floppy interface works well. Maybe some minor corrections to be made, but in it's current state it is very usable.
