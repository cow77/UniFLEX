My eye catched the Econet interface that was popular some years ago with the BBC 
computer. The hardware revolves around the MC68B54. I found it interesting
enough to create a pop-up for the CPU09GPP (_and_ CPU09FLX) board.

I have not yet made up my mind how the network is to be implemented. Options are
exclusive for UniFLEX, but I can envision diskless FLEX system too. 

It will be fun to play with those during the long winter eveneings

I have ordered a couple of prototype boards already. One area where we need to
give in is, CPU speed of the CPU09GPP, with the 09ECN board the max. Xtal will
be around 10 MHz as there are no faster MC68B54 around.

But that is still very fast :-). 

To be continued.......
