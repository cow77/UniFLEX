 Last weeks I am making headway with the project.

The REV 0.9 board has no known flaws. The LT3080 voltage regulator is more than
capable to power the W5500.

I made 2 simple (piping) utilities to upload/download data between Linux
and UniFLEX.

Linux:   nc -l  -p 32100 >UniFLEX-file
UniFLEX: w2sock <UniFLEX-file

or the other way

Linux:   cat UniFLEX-file |nc -l -p 32100 -q0
UniFLEX: sock2r >UniFLEX-file

One big advantage is the UniFLEX (6X09) has already the bytes
in network order. (big endian).

One major thing I hope to achieve with the UDP implementation is:

TNFS

This should allow 'mounting' an UniFLEX directory node onto a Linux 
tnfs server. From there I believe I would be able to access the exposed
UniFLEX filesystem part from Linux.

There are a few implementations of tnfsd, most binary, one is a Perl version.

To give an idea of the effort I am going through I posted LIST which is the code
for the GPP up to now. (one error in unused code)

The kernel code organization is:  socket.t ===> wzdrvr.t ===> fio_han.t to
reach the dual port RAM, where the GPP CPU sits at the other side.
