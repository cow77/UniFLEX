CPU09IOP

Provides:
Dedicated HD63C09 at 4 MHz busclock with no wait states
IO address region of 256 bytes
Can drive multiple CPU09SR4 boards on a separate backplane
Serial port interrupt off-load for main CPU
Extendable with other IO boards
32 KB of RAM
up to 16 KB of (E)(P()ROM
LED's that signal access from main CPU and IO access


Description:
The CPU09IOP has a 256 byte dual-port RAM interface with the main CPU.The upper two locations are postboxes with interrupt
generation when written. One is for main CPU to IOP CPU, the other is for IOP CPU to main CPU.
The 32KB of RAM holds all data structures, buffers and stack for the IOP. The IOP firmware is slightly over 4 KByte and
fit's easily in an 8KB (E)(P)ROM. The other socket is for a debug ROM.
The IOP drives the IO backplane via a 40 wire flatcable. An old IDE cable will fit nicely here. The max cable length is about 40 cm.
For UniFLEX a dedicated driver is available. The basic version allows up to 4 CPU09SR4 boards but this can be changed at will.

The firmware and driver has undergone long tests and is to be considered stable and very capable.
